## Kudos
This plugin is entirely based on Elijah Manor's [.zshrc](https://gist.github.com/elijahmanor/b279553c0132bfad7eae23e34ceb593b) file and his excellent associated [Neovim Config Switcher - YouTube video](https://youtu.be/LkHjJlSgKZY).

And of course, huge thanks to the Neovim development team for adding the [NVIM_APPNAME](https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#%24NVIM_APPNAME) feature in the [Neovim 0.9 release](https://neovim.io/doc/user/news-0.9.html#news-0.9)
